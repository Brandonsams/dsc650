# DSC 650 - Big Data

This course covers the fundamentals of data infrastructure and how technologies fit together to form a process, or pipeline, to refine data into usable datasets. This course focuses on building a predictive modeling pipeline used by the various types of projects that are called, “big data.”

See the [DSC 650 documentation][dsc650-docs] for more information on getting started with the course material.
